Well, since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

Where I'll be, I'll be so lonely, baby
I'll be lonely
I'll be so lonely, I could die

Well, although it's always crowded
You still could find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

They'll be so, they'll be so lonely, baby
Be so lonely
They'll get so lonely, they could die

Play it, Dan

Well, now, if your baby leaves you
You need a place to dwell
Just take a walk down Lonely Street
To, to, to, to

You'll be so lonely, baby
You will be lonely
You'll be so lonely, you could die

Thank you
